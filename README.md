# ROSinGrasshopper
Collection of Tutorials for integrating ROS in grasshopper3d; based on docker, compas_fab, bengesht, etc.


This repository contains tutorials integration of [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) (Robotic Operating System) as a backend software for [Grasshopper3D ](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/)(Algorithmic modeling tool for Rhinoceros). These methods facilitates design to robotic production workflows as well as real-time and adaptive robotic fabrication workflows.


# Requirements

- Operating System: You can use Mac or Windows 10 operating systems for most of the tutorials. However, Windows 10 is suggested for better Compatibility with Grasshopper. 
- [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) for Visual Studio Code
- [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/) and [Grasshopper 3D](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/)
    - [GhPython](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/ghpython)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- [Compas Fab](https://gramaziokohler.github.io/compas_fab/latest/getting_started.html)
